Note, that if the array has two intersecting continuous non-decreasing subsequence, they 
can be combined into one. Therefore, you can just pass the array from left to right. If the
current subsequence can be continued using the i-th element, then we do it, otherwise we start 
a new one. The answer is the maximum subsequence of all the found ones.

Asymptotics â€” O(n).
